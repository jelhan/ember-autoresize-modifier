<h3>Default: empty text area without styles</h3>

<h3>Fits existing content on initial render</h3>
<textarea {{autoresize}}>
  Some content with line breaks. This is a new line. And the third line. And a
  very long string that does not fit into one line. Cause it has even more
  content.

<h3>Resizes when value changes upstream</h3>
<p>
  The value of both textareas is bound to each other. If you change it in one,
  it's reflected in the other as well. Both resize automatically to fit the
  value regardless if value is entered directly or updated upstream.
